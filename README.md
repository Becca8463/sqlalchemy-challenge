# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this module I was tasked to analyze and explore the climate data of Honolulu, Hawaii. By using python and SQLAlchemy I was able to connect to my SQLite database,create tables and reflect into classes, preform a precipitation and station analysis. I used found the most recent date with data and queried that last year. I then designed a climate app.
